# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Due to frequent breaking changes from the HoYoverse/Cognosphere regarding update functionality (game repair indexes, cache files, compressed update packages, etc.), we can only guarantee support the latest Stable & Preview versions of Collapse.
Additionally, due to major rework in Collapse update infrastructure, any versions of Collapse prior to 1.69.0 **is not supported** and should be updated ASAP to the latest version. This could be done by either using the new built-in updater or by doing a clean install of Collapse.

| Version  | Supported          |
|----------| ------------------ |
| >=1.80.0 | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.73 | :x:                |
