**Collapse** was originally designed for **Honkai Impact 3rd**. However, as the project evolved, this launcher is now a game client for all currently released **miHoYo Games**.

# Why "Collapse"?
Collapse came from the **Honkai Impact** translation in Chinese and Japanese. The word came from [**崩坏**] or **Bēng huài** in Chinese and also [**崩壊**] or **Houkai** in Japanese, both meaning "**Collapse**" which is why we chose it as our launcher name with the added inspiration that this was supposed to be an alternative (enhanced) launcher for *Honkai Impact 3rd* in the first place.

**Collapse** contains advanced features for **Honkai Impact 3rd** that not only provide you with the ability to download and launch the game, but also some additional features that the Official Launcher doesn't have, including:
* Caches Download (aka "Updating Settings" in-game).
* Game Data Repair (with less bandwidth required than the *Data Repair* feature in-game).
* Changing Game Settings (Graphics Settings & Audio Settings) without opening the game.
* Multi-Region Game Download Support (Allows for downloading and launching different versions of the game).
* Steam to Global version conversion (without re-downloading the whole game).
* Global to SEA version (or vice versa) conversion.
* Multi-session Download for faster Game Download/Installation.
* Multi-thread Game Extraction for faster installation.
* Delta-Patch Update Mechanism for smaller updates ([**Click here**](https://github.com/neon-nyan/CollapseLauncher/wiki/Update-Game-Region-with-Delta-Patch) for more info).
* Ability to select Graphics API (DirectX 11 (FL: 10.1, 11.0 and 11.1) and DirectX 12 [May crash the game in newer stages]).

Not only that, this launcher also has some advanced features for **Genshin Impact**, including but not limited to:
* Choosing your voice-line language during the first installation, so you don't have to download it inside the game.
* Repair the game files including Game Caches, Cutscenes, Audio Pack & persistent files outside of the game.

# System Requirements for Ready-to-use build
- OS: **Windows 10 1809 Update (build 17763)** or later / **Windows 11 (Any builds)**
- Architecture: **x64/AMD64**
- Internet Access: **Yes**

# Prerequisites for Building Locally/Development
## More information can be found in [**Contribution Guidelines**](https://github.com/neon-nyan/Collapse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
*Collapse* is presently powered by .NET 7 and as such, the packages listed below are required to create a local and development build of the launcher. Furthermore, *Collapse* uses many submodules and packages outside of this, which will automatically be loaded when the user sets up a local environment of the application.
1. **Visual Studio 2022 (Any Edition - 17.4 or later)**
2. **Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19043.0) or Windows 11 SDK (10.0.22000.0)** via Visual Studio Installer
3. .NET: [**.NET Core 7 SDK (7.0.100 or later)**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
4. WinUI 3: [**WinUI 3 (WindowsAppSDK 1.3.0-230331000 Stable Runtime)**](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.3/1.3.230331000/windowsappruntimeinstall-x64.exe)

> **Note**:
> 
> Starting from November 13<sup>rd</sup> 2022, you <b>must</b> have Visual Studio 2022 installed on your computer due to the updated minimum system requirement of `WinUI 3 1.3 Stable`.
> 
> Using a lower Visual Studio version (like VS2019) is possible, but it is not recommended as you need to downgrade **WindowsAppSDK** via *NuGet* to **WindowsAppSDK 1.1.5** or **WindowsAppSDK 1.2-preview2** before building. This has an increased risk of breaking the application and as such, minimal support will be provided for this method. **This is not recommended for beginner users.**
